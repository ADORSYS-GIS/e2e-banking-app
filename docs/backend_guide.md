# API Documentation

    The Power Payment Backend exposes various APIs with the following endpoints:

        - POST /api/users: Create a new user account. Request body should include user details.
        - POST /api/payments: Initiate a money transfer between users. Request body should include transfer details.
        - GET /api/payments/{paymentId}: Get details of a specific payment by ID.
        - GET /api/users/{userId}/transactions: Get transaction history for a specific user.
        - GET /api/users/{userId}/balance: Get balance for a specific user.
        - DELETE /api/users/{userId}: Delete a user account by ID.

For each endpoint, provide examples of requests and responses along with the expected request and response formats.


# Database Schema

    The Power Payment Backend is a secure system for seamless money transfers. Here's an example of the database schema that supports it.

    - User Table:

        user_id (Primary Key)
        username
        email
        password
        date_created

    - Transaction History Table:

        transaction_history_id (Primary Key)
        transaction_id (Foreign Key referencing Transaction Table)
        status (e.g., pending, completed, failed)
        date_updated

    - Transaction Table:

        transaction_id (Primary Key)
        sender_id (Foreign Key referencing User Table)
        receiver_id (Foreign Key referencing User Table)
        amount
        date_created

This schema includes tables for users, transactions, and transaction history. The user table stores user information, including username, email, and password. The transaction table tracks payment transactions between users, including sender, receiver, and amount. The transaction history table records the status and update timestamps for each transaction. Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and the actual database schema for the Power Pay App may require additional tables and relationships. 


# Authentication

    In the backend, the authentication process for smartphone and Choronko users in the Power Payment system are handled using specific mechanisms and workflows.

        1. Smartphone User Authentication:

            * User Registration: When a smartphone user registers, they provide their phone number, which is stored in the user database.
            * OTP Generation and Delivery: Upon registration, an OTP is generated and sent to the user's phone number via SMS using an SMS gateway or service provider.
            * OTP Verification: The backend validates the OTP entered by the user against the one stored in the database. If the OTP matches, the user is considered authenticated.
            * PIN Setup: After successful OTP verification, the user is prompted to set a PIN for subsequent authentication. The PIN is securely stored in the user database, preferably using hashing and salting techniques.
            
        2. Choronko User Authentication:

            * SMS Gateway Integration: The backend integrates with an SMS gateway to receive and interpret messages sent by Choronko users.
            * Syntax Interpretation: The SMS gateway extracts the phone number and PIN from the incoming message using the specified syntax, such as numberpin#.
            * PIN Verification: The backend verifies the received PIN against the one stored in the Choronko user's database record. If the PIN matches, the user is considered authenticated.


# Error Handling

    Error handling is an essential aspect of any application, including the Power Payment Backend, to ensure smooth operation and a positive user experience. Proper error handling involves identifying, capturing, and appropriately responding to errors that may occur during the execution of backend processes. Below is an explanation of how error handling should be done in the backend, along with examples:

    - HTTP Status Codes:

        The app utilizes appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of the error, allowing clients to understand the response at a glance.

        For example, a 400 status code can be used for client-side errors (e.g., invalid request parameters), while a 500 status code can be used for server-side errors (e.g., internal server errors).

    - Error Logging and Notification:

       To ensure effective issue monitoring and troubleshooting, errors in the Power Payment Backend should be logged to a centralized logging system or a dedicated log file. This logging mechanism should include essential details such as timestamps, error messages, and stack traces. This enables developers and system administrators to analyze and resolve issues efficiently. Additionally, notifications or alerts can be triggered to promptly notify the relevant individuals or teams when critical errors occur. This ensures swift action can be taken to address and resolve the issues.

       Example Implementation in Spring Boot:

            1. Error Logging:

            Configure the logging framework in Spring Boot to capture and log errors to a centralized logging system or dedicated log file. For example, using the default logging framework, errors can be logged with the appropriate severity level:

                ``` import org.slf4j.Logger;
                    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

                    public class PaymentService {
                        // Create a logger instance for the PaymentService class
                        private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PaymentService.class);

                        public void processPayment(Payment payment) {
                            try {
                                // Code that may generate an error
                            } catch (Exception e) {
                                // Log the error message and stack trace using the logger's error method
                                logger.error("An error occurred while processing payment", e);
                            }   
                        }
                    }```

            2. Centralized Logging System:

            Configure the Power Payment Backend to use a centralized logging system, such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). This allows for the aggregation, analysis, and visualization of logs from different components of the backend.

            3. Error Notifications:

            Utilize a notification service or tool to trigger alerts when critical errors occur. For example, you can configure an email notification to be sent to the development team or a dedicated Slack channel. This ensures the right people are promptly informed of critical issues. Here's an example using Spring Boot's email notification:

               ```  import org.springframework.mail.SimpleMailMessage;
                    import org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSender;
                    import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

                    @Component
                    public class ErrorNotificationService {
                        private final JavaMailSender emailSender;

                        public ErrorNotificationService(JavaMailSender emailSender) {
                            // Initialize the ErrorNotificationService with the JavaMailSender dependency
                            this.emailSender = emailSender;
                        }

                        public void sendErrorNotification(String errorMessage) {
                            // Create a new SimpleMailMessage instance
                            SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
                            
                            // Set the recipient's email address
                            message.setTo("developer@example.com");
                            
                            // Set the email subject
                            message.setSubject("Critical Error in Power Payment Backend");
                            
                            // Set the body of the email with the provided error message
                            message.setText(errorMessage);

                            // Send the email message using the emailSender instance
                            emailSender.send(message);
                        }
                    }```

                In the error handling logic, call the sendErrorNotification method when a critical error is encountered:

                    ```import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

                        @Service
                        public class PaymentService {
                            private final ErrorNotificationService errorNotificationService;

                            public PaymentService(ErrorNotificationService errorNotificationService) {
                                this.errorNotificationService = errorNotificationService;
                            }

                            public void processPayment(Payment payment) {
                                try {
                                    // Code that may generate an error
                                } catch (Exception e) {
                                    logger.error("An error occurred while processing payment", e);
                                    errorNotificationService.sendErrorNotification("An error occurred while processing payment: " + e.getMessage());
                                }
                            }
                        }```

                    By implementing error logging to a centralized system and triggering notifications, the Power Payment Backend ensures effective issue monitoring and prompt resolution, contributing to a reliable and robust system.

    - Exception Handling:

        Exceptions should be caught and handled appropriately to prevent application crashes and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

        Example: If a database connection error occurs while processing a payment transaction, an exception can be caught, and the user can be informed that there was a temporary issue and to try again later.

    - User-Friendly Error Messages:

        Error messages should be user-friendly, informative, and provide actionable instructions or suggestions whenever possible.

        Example: If a user attempts to authenticate with an incorrect PIN, they can be presented with an error message stating, "Invalid PIN. Please double-check your PIN and try again."

    - Graceful Degradation:

        The backend should gracefully handle errors and degrade functionality when necessary to maintain system stability and prevent cascading failures.

        Example: If an external API used for a specific feature is temporarily unavailable, the backend can gracefully degrade by presenting an alternative workflow or disabling the feature temporarily until the API becomes accessible again.

        ``` @RestController
            public class MyController {

                @Autowired
                private ExternalApiService externalApiService;

                @GetMapping("/api/feature")
                public ResponseEntity<?> getFeature() {
                    try {
                        // Call the external API to retrieve feature data
                        FeatureData featureData = externalApiService.getFeatureData();

                        // Process the feature data and return a response
                        // ...

                        return ResponseEntity.ok(featureData);
                    } catch (ExternalApiUnavailableException e) {
                        // Handle the case when the external API is unavailable
                        // Present an alternative workflow or disable the feature temporarily

                        // Return an informative response to the client
                        String errorMessage = "The feature is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.";
                        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE).body(errorMessage);
                    }
                }
            }```

            The provided code snippet demonstrates how to gracefully degrade a feature in the backend when an external API used for that feature is temporarily unavailable. It handles a GET request to the /api/feature endpoint and tries to retrieve feature data from the external API. If the external API is unavailable, it catches the exception, presents an alternative workflow or temporarily disables the feature, and returns a 503 Service Unavailable response with an informative error message. This approach ensures a smooth user experience and manages expectations during the temporary unavailability of the external API.

    - Error Response Formats:

        The backend should provide consistent error response formats, such as JSON or XML, that include relevant error codes, messages, and additional details for easier identification and debugging by client applications.

        Example: An API request that fails due to missing required parameters can return a JSON response with an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and a message indicating the missing parameters.

        ``` import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
            import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
            import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
            import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
            import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

            @RestController
            public class MyController {

                @PostMapping("/api/endpoint")
                public ResponseEntity<?> processRequest(@RequestBody RequestBodyData requestBodyData) {
                    // Check if the required parameters are present
                    if (requestBodyData.getParam1() == null || requestBodyData.getParam2() == null) {
                        // Return a JSON response with an appropriate error code (400 Bad Request)
                        // and a message indicating the missing parameters
                        String errorMessage = "Missing required parameters: param1, param2";
                        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body(errorMessage);
                    }
                    
                    // Process the request and return a successful response
                    // ...
                    
                    return ResponseEntity.ok("Request processed successfully");
                }
            }```

        The provided code snippet above demonstrates a RESTful API endpoint implemented using Spring Boot. It handles a POST request to the /api/endpoint endpoint and checks for missing required parameters (param1 and param2). If any of the parameters are missing, it constructs a JSON response with a 400 Bad Request status code and an error message indicating the missing parameters. Otherwise, it processes the request and returns a successful response with a 200 OK status code. This approach allows clients to receive clear error messages when required parameters are absent and ensures proper handling of requests with all necessary parameters.

    - Input Validation and Sanitization:

        Input data should be validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

        Example: Prior to processing a user's input for a payment amount, the backend should validate that it is a valid numeric value and sanitize it to remove any potential harmful characters.

        - Integration Testing:

            Perform integration tests that simulate end-to-end payment processing flows, including interactions with external payment gateways and data updates in the backend.

            Example: Validate that when a payment transaction is initiated, the correct payment gateway is called, the response is handled appropriately, and user balances are updated accordingly.

    3. Transaction History:

        - Unit Testing:

            Write unit tests to ensure the accuracy of the transaction history functionality, focusing on individual methods responsible for retrieving and filtering transaction records.

            Example: Test that a method filtering transactions by date range returns the expected results when provided with specific date inputs.

        - Integration Testing:

            Conduct integration tests that validate the end-to-end flow of retrieving and displaying transaction history, including interactions with the database or other data sources.

            Example: Verify that when a request for transaction records is made, the backend retrieves the relevant data from the database and presents it accurately.
