# Database Schema

    The Power Payment Backend is a secure system for seamless money transfers. Here's an example of the database schema that supports it.

    - User Table:

        user_id (Primary Key)
        username
        email
        password
        date_created

    - Transaction History Table:

        transaction_history_id (Primary Key)
        transaction_id (Foreign Key referencing Transaction Table)
        status (e.g., pending, completed, failed)
        date_updated

    - Transaction Table:

        transaction_id (Primary Key)
        sender_id (Foreign Key referencing User Table)
        receiver_id (Foreign Key referencing User Table)
        amount
        date_created

This schema includes tables for users, transactions, and transaction history. The user table stores user information, including username, email, and password. The transaction table tracks payment transactions between users, including sender, receiver, and amount. The transaction history table records the status and update timestamps for each transaction. Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and the actual database schema for the Power Pay App may require additional tables and relationships. 


# Authentication

    In the backend, the authentication process for smartphone and Choronko users in the Power Payment system are handled using specific mechanisms and workflows.

        1. Smartphone User Authentication:

            * User Registration: When a smartphone user registers, they provide their phone number, which is stored in the user database.
            * OTP Generation and Delivery: Upon registration, an OTP is generated and sent to the user's phone number via SMS using an SMS gateway or service provider.
            * OTP Verification: The backend validates the OTP entered by the user against the one stored in the database. If the OTP matches, the user is considered authenticated.
            * PIN Setup: After successful OTP verification, the user is prompted to set a PIN for subsequent authentication. The PIN is securely stored in the user database, preferably using hashing and salting techniques.
            
        2. Choronko User Authentication:

            * SMS Gateway Integration: The backend integrates with an SMS gateway to receive and interpret messages sent by Choronko users.
            * Syntax Interpretation: The SMS gateway extracts the phone number and PIN from the incoming message using the specified syntax, such as numberpin#.
            * PIN Verification: The backend verifies the received PIN against the one stored in the Choronko user's database record. If the PIN matches, the user is considered authenticated.


# Error Handling

    Error handling is an essential aspect of any application, including the Power Payment Backend, to ensure smooth operation and a positive user experience. Proper error handling involves identifying, capturing, and appropriately responding to errors that may occur during the execution of backend processes. Below is an explanation of how error handling should be done in the backend, along with examples:

    - HTTP Status Codes:

        The app utilizes appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of the error, allowing clients to understand the response at a glance.

        For example, a 400 status code can be used for client-side errors (e.g., invalid request parameters), while a 500 status code can be used for server-side errors (e.g., internal server errors).

    - Error Logging and Notification:

        Errors should be logged to a centralized logging system or a dedicated log file, along with relevant information such as timestamps, error messages, and stack traces. This allows developers and system administrators to monitor and troubleshoot issues effectively.
        Notifications or alerts can be triggered to notify the appropriate individuals or teams when critical errors occur. This ensures that prompt action can be taken to address and resolve the issues.

    - Exception Handling:

        Exceptions should be caught and handled appropriately to prevent application crashes and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

        Example: If a database connection error occurs while processing a payment transaction, an exception can be caught, and the user can be informed that there was a temporary issue and to try again later.

    - User-Friendly Error Messages:

        Error messages should be user-friendly, informative, and provide actionable instructions or suggestions whenever possible.

        Example: If a user attempts to authenticate with an incorrect PIN, they can be presented with an error message stating, "Invalid PIN. Please double-check your PIN and try again."

    - Graceful Degradation:

        The backend should gracefully handle errors and degrade functionality when necessary to maintain system stability and prevent cascading failures.

        Example: If an external API used for a specific feature is temporarily unavailable, the backend can gracefully degrade by presenting an alternative workflow or disabling the feature temporarily until the API becomes accessible again.

    - Error Response Formats:

        The backend should provide consistent error response formats, such as JSON or XML, that include relevant error codes, messages, and additional details for easier identification and debugging by client applications.

        Example: An API request that fails due to missing required parameters can return a JSON response with an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and a message indicating the missing parameters.

    - Input Validation and Sanitization:

        Input data should be validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

        Example: Prior to processing a user's input for a payment amount, the backend should validate that it is a valid numeric value and sanitize it to remove any potential harmful characters.


# Testing

    Each backend feature of the Power Pay app should undergo thorough testing using written code or test frameworks to ensure its functionality and reliability. By writing test cases and using appropriate frameworks, you can automate the testing process and identify potential issues early on. Here are some examples of how different backend features can be tested:

    1. User Authentication:

        Testing Framework: JUnit or TestNG

        Example: Write test cases to validate user authentication by simulating login requests with different credentials and asserting the expected behavior, such as successful login or authentication failure.

    2. Payment Processing:

        Testing Framework: JUnit or TestNG

        Example: Create test cases to verify payment processing functionality, including mocking external payment gateways and asserting the correct calculation of transaction fees and the update of user balances.

    3. Transaction History:

        Testing Framework: JUnit or TestNG

        Example: Write test cases to ensure the accuracy of transaction history by simulating requests for transaction records, filtering by date range or transaction type, and asserting the correct display of transaction details.

    4. Error Handling:

        Testing Framework: JUnit or TestNG

        Example: Test the backend's error handling capabilities by writing test cases that intentionally trigger errors, such as sending invalid inputs or simulating database connection failures, and asserting the correct error responses or exception handling behavior.
