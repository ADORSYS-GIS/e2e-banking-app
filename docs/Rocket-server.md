Rust Rocket Server with Serde Integration

Overview:
This Rust project integrates a base server using the Rocket framework and implements support for serialization and deserialization with Serde, serde_json, and serde_derive. The primary objective is to establish a robust backend foundation for efficient data handling.

Setup:

    Dependencies:
        Ensure Rocket, serde, serde_json, and serde_derive are added to the Cargo.toml file.

    Configuration:
        Create a main.rs file and set up a basic Rocket server to handle incoming HTTP requests.
        Implement an index endpoint for testing purposes.

    Serialization and Deserialization:
        Serde is utilized for seamless data exchange between the server and clients. No additional setup is required.

    Docker Configuration:
        Update the Dockerfile to expose the server port (e.g., EXPOSE 8000).

Usage:

    Building the Server:
        Run cargo build to compile the Rust project.

    Running the Server:
        Execute cargo run to start the Rocket server.

    Interacting with Endpoints:
        Access the server endpoints via HTTP requests (e.g., http://localhost:8000).

Example:

    Upon running the server, navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to view the "Welcome to Power Pay App!" message.

NB:

    Ensure that Docker is installed and running to utilize the Dockerfile configuration.

                                         Introduction

    This document outlines the process of how we added a /health endpoint to our Rust-based server using the Rocket web framework. The /health endpoint provides a simple mechanism for monitoring the server's health and availability.

                                          Objectives

    Develop a /health endpoint that returns a standard JSON response indicating the server's operational status.
    Ensure the response format includes a status field indicating success.

                                        Implementation Steps

    Endpoint Definition: Define a new route in the Rocket application for the /health endpoint. This route should be accessible via a HTTP GET request and require no parameters.

    Handler Function: Implement a handler function for the /health endpoint. This function should construct and return a JSON response indicating that the server's status is "ok".

    Testing: Write unit and integration tests to verify that the /health endpoint behaves as expected under various conditions, including server start-up and running states.

    Documentation Update: Update the project documentation to include details about the /health endpoint. Explain its purpose, the expected response format, and any relevant information for developers or system administrators.

                                               Conclusion

    By following these steps, you can successfully add a /health endpoint to your Rust-based server using the Rocket web framework. This endpoint plays a vital role in ensuring the server's health and availability, enabling seamless monitoring and integration with external systems or services.
